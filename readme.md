# OData Samples for .NET Framework

## Introduction

This repository contains sample that I use during OData workshops. The samples use .NET Framework, not .NET Core.

**Note** that the samples with names starting with *OData* are based on official samples [provided by the OData project](https://github.com/OData/ODataSamples). They are slightly updated, I fixed some bugs, and added some extensions.
